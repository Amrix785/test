store d, m, y, and i as an integer

ask the user for the date
store what the user says as d-day m-month and y-year

if the year is a multiple of 4
then correct for the leap year by adding a day to february

if the year is less than 1900, or if the month is less than 1 or greater than 12, of if the day is less than 1 or greater than the number of days in the month
